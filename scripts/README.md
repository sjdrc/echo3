# echo3 installer

## Setting up the echo3 game engine
Install Echo3 by executing the following command in a command line terminal:

    sudo ./SetupEcho.sh

There will be several command line prompts that will ask you how you wish to install the game engine. 
Answer these questions as you wish.

If you encounter errors, rerun the same command and try again.

## Futher information
The other scripts in this directory are automatically run by `SetupEcho.sh` and, therefore, calling them directly is reserved for advanced use only.

For more information, please refer to [the Echo3 Developer Wiki](https://developer.emblem.net.au/w/projects/echo_3/building/).

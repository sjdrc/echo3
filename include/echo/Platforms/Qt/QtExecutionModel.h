		// Typically if a platform implements this model there will be additional functions
		// for the handling of messages. It may be a single function to receive events or
		// numerous functions accessed through registered functors. However events are
		// handled Echo expects to be updated and rendered manually by calls to
		// gEchoKernel().ProcessFrame()
		//
		// This function should return true if everything went to plan and return false
		// if the Model::CONTROLLER model is unavailable.
		//
		// IMPORTANT: Because some systems may not be able to receive events before the
		// main event loop it is important that you process any initialisation events
		// and make a call to SendUpdateRequest() (see below) in order to trigger the
		// first update. You DO NOT need to continue calling SendUpdateRequest() when
		// an update event has been received. Echo will do this at the appropriate time
		// before returning from gEchoKernel().ProcessFrame() (see note below about
		// sending event tricks).

		// if Echo should call again. Return false if the CONTROLLER model is not available.
		// Echo will not call this if a call to SupportsModel(Models::CONTROLLER) returns
		// false.
		//
		// This function SHOULD NOT block.
		//
		// NOTE: If your system does not support the sending of events in a non-blocking
		// way (a way to post a message to a queue to be processed later) then you can
		// perform a little trick to manage the sending of the update request in your own
		// way by making SendUpdateRequest() do nothing but returning true. Then after you
		// process the update event (and call Kernel::UpdateFrame()) you can handle
		// the sending of the event in your own way.
